Regression Acceptance Tests

This suite ensures that all defined features remain functional.  Only
acceptance tests that are expected to ALWAYS PASS should live here.

Tests that are NOT FINISHED, or are failing because their targeted
features are UNDER DEVELOPMENT, go in the "dev" directory parallel to
this "regression" dir.

This applies to acceptance tests that are being redressed, or
whose target features are back under actual development.
