Hamsterdam v1.0.2
  * Field name defs, constructor keys and merge keys are now stringified internally to prevent string/symbol mismatching
  * Added syntax helper for this kind of thing: class Castle < Hamsterdam::Struct(:gate, :walls)

Hamsterdam v1.0.1
  * Added nice to_s and inspect
	* Also storing .field_names_list as another way of getting field names of a struct, but retaining order of declaration (.field_names is a Hamster.set, .field_names_list is a Hamster.list)

Hamsterdam v1.0.0
  * Can define immutable record types via Hamsterdam::Struct.define(*field_names)
	* Provides getters for all fields, and set_* transformers that return the updated version of the record.
	* Handy merge function for updating one or more fields by name
	* Wraps Hamaster's (https://github.com/harukizaemon/hamster) immutable Hamster::Hash class
